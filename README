==================
Ninja
==================

*Ninja* is a small build system with a focus on speed.

See the manual -- http://martine.github.com/ninja/manual.html or
`doc/manual.asciidoc <doc/manual.html>`_ included in the distribution -- for background
and more details.

To build, run `./bootstrap.py`.  It first blindly compiles all non-test source
files together, then re-builds *Ninja* using itself and `./build.ninja`.  You
should end up with a *Ninja* binary in the source root.  Run `./ninja -h` for
help.

**There is no installation step!**  The only file of interest to a user is the
resulting *Ninja* binary.

You may install it yourself with::

  sudo install ninja /usr/local/bin
